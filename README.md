# Enemy Loss Tracker

Enemy Loss Tracker is an iOS application developed as a test task for the MacPaw Bootcamp programme for the position of Junior macOS/iOS Software Engineer. The purpose of the app is to display data on russian losses during the russian invasion of Ukraine

## Project Details

- **Xcode Version:** 14.3
- **Programming Languages:** Swift
- **User Interface:** Built using UIKit programmatically

## Screens

1. **SplashView Screen:** The initial screen that users see when they start the application. It's used for application initialization.

2. **Losses Screen:** This screen displays the total losses of enemy military equipment and personnel based on data received on a specific date.

3. **Equipment Losses Screen:** This screen lists military equipment losses. It provides search functionality and allows users to view detailed information about selected equipment categories.

4. **Equipment Losses Detail View:** This screen opens when a specific row is selected on the Equipment Losses screen. It provides additional information about the loss of a particular piece of equipment, such as model, manufacturer, and total loss amount.

5. **Donations Screen:** This screen displays a list of charitable contributions or donors. It allows users to interact with individual donors, navigate to detailed information, or visit the donor's website.

## Data Source

The application fetches data from the repository [https://github.com/MacPaw/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/tree/main/data](https://github.com/MacPaw/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/tree/main/data) using the URLSession class. Core Data framework is used to store and manage the downloaded data, which is then decoded and processed.

## Technologies Used

- **URLSession**: Interacting with external resources (APIs, JSON files, etc.).
- **Core Data**: Storing and managing downloaded data.
- **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**: Controlling parallel and asynchronous task processing.
- **MVC Design Pattern**: Organizing the application's architecture.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Managing global data and functionality.
- **Unit Testing**: Creating unit tests for various components of the application.
- **Apple Human Interface Guidelines**: Designing the user interface according to Apple's guidelines.
